# Computer Science (Python) Tutoring

During the academic year of 2022/2023, I was in charge of organizing additional study sessions for the students of *(07JCJLM) Computer Sciences* to help them prepare for their exams.

You can find here the exercises and solutions provided to students along with extra cheat sheets and much more.
