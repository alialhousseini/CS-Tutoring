## Municipalities Search
A tourism magazine asks you to develop a program to perform a statistical analysis of the data of Italian municipalities.

The software must open a first file with a .csv extension (whose name is provided by the user) that contains information about Italian municipalities in the following format:

```
Municipality;Region;Province;Inhabitants;Altitude
```
where **Municipality** is the name of the municipality, **Province** is the acronym of the province of belonging, and **Altitude** is the height above sea level.

The program reads in a second file (whose name is provided by the user) the acronyms of the provinces of the municipalities to analyze. This file contains one province acronym per line.

The files are assumed to be all correct.

Based on this information, the program must search for each province specified in the second file, the municipality that is at the highest altitude.

If the file indicated by the user does not exist, it is required to handle a possible error in writing the name of the file by asking the user to provide a new name.
